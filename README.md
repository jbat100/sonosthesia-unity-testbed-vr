### XR Toolkit

XRController script does not have the default actions connected. Go to the preset slider at the top right of the component inspector



## Quest 

### Build Settings

### Supported XR Plugins

### Hand tracking

Got it to work with V2, then needs to be enabled on the device OS (should ask automatically if it is specified in the settings)

Got it working with link by activating passthrough to allow hand tracking with link (in settings Beta section of the Oculus app)

Now that the passthrough beta is activated on the occulus app, generic xr interaction toolkit and xr hands demos run on windows/link from the editor
